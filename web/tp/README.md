### Installation

After downloading your copy from CodeCanyon, you'll need to start by unpacking the ZIP file on your computer. Next, upload the everything inside the Databased Personal to your webserver. Once done, open your browser and navigate to the /install/ folder (for example, if you have uploaded the application to http://mydomain.com, you would need to open http://mydomain.com/install/ in your browser). Here you'll need to fill in your MySQL database connection details and the email address and password you want to assign to the first admin account in your application (you will login with these details once the installation has been completed).
